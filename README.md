## bash-scripts

Some simple and useful shell scripts to automate tedious tasks, run automatically via crontab.

1. `backup-crontabs.sh`: updates a text file (`crontabs.txt`) with the currently active cronjobs
2. `fetch-all-repos.sh`: runs through all of my Git repositories and fetches them from GitHub after committing/pushing any changes
3. `maintain-spotikill.sh`: simple script to kill my spotify-ad-killer script and restart it every 6 hours as "maintenance" to reflect any changes made to the script
4. `unsplash-wp.sh`: moves all `*.jpg` files downloaded from Unsplash from Downloads to a designated folder

### misc

Various useless or deprecated python scripts.
